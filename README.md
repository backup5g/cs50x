# CS50 Problem Sets
The Harvard CS50 "Introduction to Computer Science" is a course that covers all most important principles of Computer Science. This repository contains all problem sets of the course that I complete. 

## Space Racing
The challenge of the Week0 was a Scratch Game, that should be done by applying the concepts shown in the first class. I made a racing game who contains variables and different characters.

## Hello
In Week1, we learned the C language, and the problem they gave us was print a Hello World in the terminal.
